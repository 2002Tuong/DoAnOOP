Pronounce: 
- As an excellent strategist, Lê Đại Hành (941-1005) was the king founding Nhà Tiền Lê (Pre-Le Dynasty) (980-1009). His native land was in Thọ Xuân (Thanh Hoá). Born in a poor family, Lê Hoàn (future Lê Đại Hành) was an orphan from his early childhood but very studious. He was appointed as Commander-in-chief by Đinh Tiên Hoàng. In 979, after Đinh Tiên Hoàng had been assassinated, Lê Hoàn became the regent because Đinh Tiên Hoàng 's successor remained too young. In 980, the Tống Chinese dynasty prepared to annex our country. In 981, the queen mother Dương Vân Nga and the armed forces unanimously enthroned Lê Hoàng as Lê Đại Hành. In 981, Lê Đại Hành trounced the Tống invaders on Bạch Đằng River and at Chi Lăng Pass. After Lê Đại Ha`nh's death in 1005, his son Lê Long Đĩnh killed his elder brother to usurp the throne. Indulging in debauchery, this cruel king Lê Long Đĩnh always stretched out at the royal conferences, therefore he was also called Lê Ngoa. Triều (Ngoa. Triều means "To stretch out at the royal conferences"). After his death, Lý Công Uẩn replaced him in 1009 and founded Nhà Hậu Lý (Post-Ly Dynasty)
