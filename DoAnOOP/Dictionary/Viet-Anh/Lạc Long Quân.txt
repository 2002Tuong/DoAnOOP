Pronounce: 
- Lạc Long Quân - son of Kinh Dương Vương and Long Nữ (Long Vương's daughter) - had an unusual strength. His father entrusted him with governing the Lĩnh Nam region, suppressing the demons and teaching the people to grow water-rice, to cook rice and to cut wood for building houses. Lạc Long Quân married Âu Cơ - Đế Lai's daughter - who would give birth to a 100-egg bag hatching into 100 sons. 50 out of them followed their father to go down in sea, and the remainder followed their mother to go up in the mountains and became the ancestors of the Việt people. The eldest son was nobody other than King Hùng. So, the Việt people always consider themselves as " Dragon's children, Fairy's grandchildren". Geographically, this legend reflected the process of exploiting mountains and Northern Delta by the Việt people
