Pronounce: 
- Nguyễn Du (1766-1820) - a great classical poet - had Tiên Điền (Nghi Xuân, Hà Tĩnh) as native land. Nguyễn Du was descended from a noble mandarin family (his father and his elder brother had been prime ministers of Nhà Hậu Lê), but he himself had to pass through many hardships in the 18th century full of troubles. Famous for writing talent, he only graduated as junior bachelor. In 1802, as a mandarin of Nhà Nguyễn, he was hauntingly worried about the current circumstances. His works were both realistic and romantic. He was the author of Truyện Kiều (a very popular poetic masterpiece), Văn Chiêu Hồn, Bắc Hành Tạp Lục and Nam Trung Tạp Ngâm. World Peace Council classifies Nguyễn Du among+memorable cultural celebrities in the world
