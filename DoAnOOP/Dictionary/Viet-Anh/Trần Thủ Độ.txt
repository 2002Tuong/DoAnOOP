- Trần Thủ Độ (1194-1264) was an eminent politician. With Hưng Hà (Thai Binh) as native village, Trần Thủ Độ was born in a dignitary's family. He commanded the corps in defence of Nhà Hậu Lý (Post-Ly Dynasty)'s royal capital, then made artful arrangements for the abdication of Lý Chiêu Hoàng in favour of Trần Cảnh, which would form the Nhà Trần (Trần Dynasty). Becoming the royal chancellor, he was a good ruler and achieved many merits in the resistance war against the Mongol invaders in 1258. Trần Thủ Độ was famous for his saying: " Whenever my head has not fallen on the ground, I beg Your Majesty not to worry"
